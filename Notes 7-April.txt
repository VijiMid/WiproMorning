We can't create autoincrement to a varchar field, but can create primary key.

create table Emp(empid varchar(50) not null primary key, empname varchar(50) not null, jobid int, FOREIGN key(jobid) REFERENCES job(jobid) , city varchar(50));

* - return all records and all columns.


select jobid, jobname,salary, (salary+(salary*30/100)+(salary*10/100) "Total Salary" from job;

Aggregate/Scalar function (This kind of functions can return only one output)
1. sum
2. avg
3. min
4. max
5. count

Group by - we can use aggregate function

SELECT jobid, sum(salary) FROM `job` GROUP by salary;

SELECT jobid, count(jobid) FROM emp GROUP by jobid; 

select avg(salary),round(avg(salary)),round(avg(salary),2) from job;

select avg(distinct salary),round(avg(distinct salary)),round(avg(distinct salary),2) from job;

select avg(distinct salary),round(avg(distinct salary)),round(avg(distinct salary),2) from job groub by salary;

select * from Emp where empname like 'A%';

select * from Emp where empname like 'A%' order by empname;

SELECT avg(DISTINCT salary),round(DISTINCT avg(salary)),round(DISTINCT avg(salary),2) from job
