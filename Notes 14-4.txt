Trigger
If you insert/update/delete a table records, it should do some affect/modify another table automatically.

Real time example:
if i marked absent in attendance table of emp.

the table of salary get reduced 1 day salary for particular emp;

Trigger alos one of the mostly used topics in sql like tables, stored procedures and function.

create table empaudit(id int auto_increment primary key,empid varchar(50) not null, changedate datetime default null);


create trigger beforeupdateEmp
before update on emp
for each row
insert into empaudit set empid=old.empid,changedate=now();

update emp set Empname='Ritik Namdevvv' where empid='E018';

update emp set city='Ropar-Punjab' , empname='Ankur Chauhan' where empid='E008';
-------------------------------
Views
1. if u dont  want to view all of ur records to other roles/clients/team members/end user, you can should view with some records.

create view Empview as select jobid,jobname from job;

roles/clients/team members
select * from EmpView

create view EmpCount(empid,number) as select empid,count(*) from attendance group by type;
 
SELECT * FROM empcount;

create view  Empcountattendance as select e.empid,e.empname, count(a.empid) from emp e inner join attendance a on a.empid=e.empid and a.type=1 group by empid;

select * from Empcountattendance;

create view workingdate as select distinct cdate from attendance a,emp e where a.empid=e.empid;

select * from  workingdate;

Transaction
we can execute more than one query in a single unit.
